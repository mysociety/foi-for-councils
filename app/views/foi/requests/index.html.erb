  <h2 class="heading-medium">Requesting information about yourself</h2>

  <p>If you want information about yourself, such as a social care file, your employment record, or copies of correspondence between yourself and the council, <a href="https://www.hackney.gov.uk/subject-access-request">you should make a Subject Access request</a>.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Other ways to request information</h2>

  <h3 class="heading-small">“Business as usual” or “service” requests</h3>
  <p>Often <a href="https://www.hackney.gov.uk/contact-us">contacting the relevant department</a> directly to ask common questions can be faster than waiting for a formal FOI response. This typically works best when you’d like information such as copies of Council Tax bills, property repair records or confirmation of attending school.</p>
